    <h2 class="idaho-title">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
      <p class="idaho-paragraph">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds 
        the Salmon river. The Salmon river was given the nickname long 
        ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it 
        because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so 
        in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.<br><br>
        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river 
        and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted. The river 
        corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which 
        tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
        from sun or rain when needed.<br><br>
        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The 
        Salmon river is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United 
        States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and 
        colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the 
        late summer. There are good rapids all summer, but families with 
        children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's 
        slower, warmer water more.</p>

    <h2 class="utah-title">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
      <p class="utah-paragraph">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most 
        desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the 
        mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
        beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run 
        famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swasey's 
        Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
        scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
        and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.<br><br>
        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in six days.<br><br>
        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a national landmark.  
        This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that 
        the canyon tells.</p>

    <h2 class="arizona-title">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
      <p class="arizona-paragraph" id="arizona-bottom">This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all 
        river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.<br><br>
        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with 
        breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river experience.
        The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, 
        but with side canyons and ancient Native American ruins accessible 
        only by river.<br><br>
        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. 
        The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to 
        accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. 
        However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river 
        rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
