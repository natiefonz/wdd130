    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose for this website is to educate people about this company as well as gain more revenue 
        by getting the word out. This website is meant to grab the public eye through a professional but 
        fun presence as this company is based on adventure.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We are looking to attract a variety of people. The website should appeal to both young adults and middle ages adults.
        We want to attract active and thrill seeking individuals. On the other end, we are also hoping our website will also
        attract those who are interested in nature and visiting popular nature attractions. Their needs may include a safe
        environment to explore the outdoors or a guide to the adventure of a lifetime.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
