    <h2>Natelie Fonnesbeck</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Natelie. I currently live in Rexburg, ID with my husband and three cats.
    I have three younger brothers who are all in different stages of life. I also have a four step-sisters
    and one step brother! They are all also younger than me.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a degree in communication with a minor in CIT. I have really been enjoying it. I also
    work full time as an assistant team lead at a utility billing company. The combination of these two things
    makes my life a lovely mix of hectic and busy. If I am being honest I would not prefer it any other way.</p>
    <p>In the rare occasion that I have free time, I like to play video games, watch a bit of television, play
    volleyball, listen to music, or bother my cats. I also love to read. My guilty pleasure is fantasy romance but I also love
    horror.</p>
    <p>I am excited to learn with all of you! Feel free to ask me any questions! I love book, music, and movie
    recommendations. I dabble in a little bit of everything so it is hard to find something I will not enjoy.</p>
