          <h2 id="faqs-q1">/ why create this site?</h2>
          <p id="faqs-a1">
            Being a computer major has me creating many projects. Making a
            personal website that benefits my future career would be useful. I
            can showcase my work and progress, even the website itself can be
            something on its own to showcase. As I continue with my education
            and learn new skills, I can edit my website as I go to keep it up to
            date. For now, my page will be a jumble of many small projects, but
            as I get deeper into my major, I will have bigger projects that will
            be able to showcase my true capabilities. How else would I be able
            to show my future employer everything I can do in one place? The
            simple answer is creating a website that holds all the information
            they need to know about me.
          </p>
          <!-- this is the faqs question and answers -->
          <h2 id="faqs-q2">/ how often do I update the website?</h2>
          <p id="faqs-a2">
            I am updating this website every couple of weeks. Every couple of
            weeks I create something new and then with the new project I upload
            it to the website. I am not going to post everything I have created,
            just the projects that show improvement and progress in my learning.
            If there is something specific you would like to see, just submit
            the suggestion on the left.
          </p>
          <!-- this is the faqs question and answers -->
          <h2 id="faqs-q3">/ who is the intended audience?</h2>
          <p id="faqs-a3">
            Trying to locate everything I have created is going to be hard.
            Especially, if I have some projects on Git Hub, saved locally,
            uploaded on social media (i.e., LinkedIn). Having one spot for all
            projects will make it easy for me to showcase everything I am
            capable of. I plan on choosing some of the projects I have created
            and publishing them on my website for easy reference.
