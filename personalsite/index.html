          Hello! My name is Natelie Fonnesbeck. I am currently a Junior at
          Brigham Young University - Idaho studying Communication with a minor 
          in Computer Information Technology. I love finding ways to innovate and improve 
          things I interact with. Whether it is through code or communication, I like testing 
          the boundaries of efficiency.<br>
          <br>I enjoy any project that sparks my creativity. I am actively learning
          web design and computer languages such as Python, C#, and
          JavaScript. I love working on projects that challenge me since it both 
          gives me new knowledge and teaches me I can do hard things. This website is a way 
          for me to showcase some of the code I have created both for career and teaching purposes.<br>
        </p>

        <p class="experience-paragraph">
          While I am still in college, I have been lucky to experience coding for a professional purpose.
          I am a team lead at a billing utility company. The group I lead is new so I have had some amazing 
          opportunities to innovate our systems and create new work stations using my knowledge in code. I am
          still new and learning but I am hoping this website will inspire people just starting their coding 
          journey to look beyond what they think they are capable by showing them examples of what is possible.
