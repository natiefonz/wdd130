          Hello there! My name is Celeste George, and I am currently a Junior at
          Brigham Young University - Idaho studying Computer Information
          Technology (CIT). I love technology and computers. In my free time, I
          enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends.<br /><br />
          I enjoy any project that sparks my creativity. I am actively learning
          web design (HTML/CSS) and computer languages such as Python, C#, and
          JavaScript. Getting stumped on computer problems is exciting because
          they are a different form puzzles from video games.<br /><br />

        <p class="experience-paragraph">
          I am just a Junior at University and do not have much professional
          experience as of right now. However, during the Summer of 2019, I
          worked as a coding teacher at a daycare. I taught the kids how to code
          simple games in JavaScript and I helped debug their code. We played
          around with robots and drones but did not go in-depth with the code
          since the kids were about 7 to 12 years old.
