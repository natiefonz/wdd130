      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am studying Computer Information Technology as a minor. The different coding skills that I am learning through this minor as well as on my own are things I am hoping to use in the future. Because of this, I would love to create a website where I can show my different coding skills to potential employers as well as help others learning code to see what is possible and how it is done.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is any person who is interested in looking into previous code I have done and my expertise in different coding languages. The other side is for those interested in coding to see examples of college level coding and the different ways that coding can be applied to the real world. With these two different audiences put together, I would say the ages of my audience will range from teenagers to older adults.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        The home page will be welcoming page to any users that includes information about me and the purpose to the website.

      </ul>
      <h3>Main Stage</h3>
      <p>
        This page will showcase the results of code that I have written. It will act as a draw for audience members looking to learn more about coding. If they see an interesting result they can then find the correlating code example in the Behind the Scenes page. This will also act as a draw for people looking to see my range in skill. They can see the different ways I have been able to apply coding and how I could plausibly apply it to them and their company.

      <h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
      <p>
        This page will act as a reveal of the code that made the results that are shown on the Main Stage page. I am thinking I will number and name each code so when they come to this page they can find that number and name to see the code. This will give the people interested in learning code a visualization to what they could create and give possible employers a look into the variety of coding techniques I can apply.
